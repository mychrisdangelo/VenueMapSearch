Description
==========

A simplified Google Maps like app for iPhone. Category Selection was created and 
later abandoned because it is not a requirement of the Google Places API. 
IB element was removed but the code remains. You may view the search results as a list by pressing the 
list icon in the lower right hand of the map icon. Each venue with a pin in 
the map can be selected and minimal information can be looked at by pressing 
the callout. Responsive to vertical & horizontal orientations for the 
most part. iPhone only.
