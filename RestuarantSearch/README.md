Description:

Category Selection was created and later abandoned because it is
not a requirement of the Google Places API. IB element was removed but
the code remains

You may view the search results as a list by pressing the list icon in
the lower right hand of the map icon.

Each venue with a pin in the map can be selected and minimal information
can be looked at by pressing the callout.
