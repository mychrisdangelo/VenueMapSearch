Assignment 1

Description:

My code in some cases relies directly on Apple Documentation Sample code. Particularly useful for this
assignment were MapSearch, PhotoMania (Stanford 2011-2013 course)

Todo:

1. When typing restaurant keyword allow user to tap out of search bar to cancel. Also dim map.
   The choice to use searchDisplayController was primarily to embed into the navigation bar easily.
2. Changing the view. Or changing the location (after load) doesn't react as a user would expect
   
Todo before submission:

1. React when no results
2. Make sure that all energy and location services used are approved, valid and efficient
